# Shopping-List-Generator

This application is designed to help you compile a single shopping list from all your regular recipes!
It allows the user to input recipe ingredients for different meals, then use these ingredients lists to generate a weekly shopping list.

# How it works:
Running shoplist.py will launch the shopping helper, from there you are able to:
  - View the recipes already input (from the master list 'recipe_master.csv') and saved in the 'meals' folder. (Example meal files have been included in the 'meals' folder and 'recipe_master.csv' - delete the meal csv files and entries in the master list to start from scratch.)
  - Input a new recipe
  - Generate a shopping list based on the existing recipes, which is exported as a csv file

When generating the shopping list, users are able to alter the number of servings for each meal, and the ingredient amounts are adjusted before being compiled in the shopping list.
